# Expense Tracker – Python Dictionary Project
Collaborative Project by Jaycob and Muneeb

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Python-based Expense Tracker that allows users to add, view, filter, calculate, and delete expenses. The program uses **Python dictionaries** to store expense data such as category, amount, and date. The project was developed collaboratively using GitHub.
## Expense Tracker

Track your expenses using our script, it'll make sure you never spend an extra penny on anything ever again. Save, and control your spending; so you can buy that Lamborghini you always wanted... 100% real

## Usage

Download `expense_tracker.py` in `main` branch, then run `python3 expense_tracker.py` (based on python installation) in terminal. 

## ⚙️ Features   
- Add new expenses (category, amount, date)
- View all recorded expenses
- Filter expenses by category
- Calculate total expenses
- Delete expenses by ID
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Clear, modular, and well-commented code

### Track your expenses
A key feature within our program is the ability to track expenses, using `view [name]` to view your expenses and those within a certain category.

## Reflection
### Challenges Faced

Managing merge conflicts when multiple members edited the same file

Ensuring consistent variable naming across branches

Handling invalid user input without crashing the program

### How We Overcame Them

Used separate Git branches for each feature

Reviewed pull requests carefully before merging

Added try-except blocks for error handling

### Collaborative Coding Experience

We enjoyed collaborative coding because it allowed us to divide tasks efficiently and learn from each other. It was a new exprince and GitHub helped us collaboratie better and track changes clearly.
